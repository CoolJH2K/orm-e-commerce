# ORM E-Commerce
## Description
Let's say you want to start your own online business that competes with Amazon and eBay. But you're not sure where to start. Don't panic, this app has you covered!
### Why did I make this?
Every new online business needs to start somewhere, so why not provide them with some sample products to get them started? That way, they can decide whether they want to be a general e-commerce business like Amazon and eBay, or a more specialized e-commerce business like Chewy.
### What problem does this solve?
If you want to make your own e-commerce business but aren't quite sure what kind of online shop you want it to be yet, this app provides you with some sample products and their prices, tags, and categories to help get you started. If you decide later on that you want to run a general online store, that's great! If you instead want to focus purely on, say, pet products, that's also great!
### What did I learn?
I learned a **lot** about how to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests by using Sequelize. I also learned how to use Insomnia to test out a website's functionality and make sure everything runs smoothly.
